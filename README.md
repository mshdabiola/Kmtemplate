Kotlin Multiplatform Template is a robust project starter designed with a **modern multi-module architecture**. It enables seamless code sharing and modular development across **JVM**, **Android**, and **WASM** platforms. The template leverages Kotlin Multiplatform to maximize code reuse, maintainability, and scalability, making it ideal for building cross-platform applications with a clean separation of concerns and platform-specific optimizations.

This project focuses on promoting a modular, scalable, maintainable, and testable architecture. It incorporates a leading-edge tech stack and embodies the finest practices in software development. While the application may appear straightforward, it encompasses all the crucial components that lay the groundwork for a robust, large-scale application.

The design principles and architectural choices applied in this project are ideally suited for larger teams and extended application lifecycles.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture** principles, ensuring a scalable, maintainable, and testable codebase. The architecture divides the application into three main layers with clear boundaries, promoting a strong separation of concerns.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./icons/Architecture - overall.png" width="800" alt="Overall Architecture Diagram" />
</p>

### üíª Presentation Layer

This layer is closest to what the user sees on the screen. It's responsible for managing the UI state and handling user interactions.

* **View**: The UI components, built with **Compose Multiplatform**, that consume the UI state and present it to the user. They forward user interactions to the **ViewModel**.
* **ViewModel**: Manages and stores UI-related data in a lifecycle-aware way. It exposes the **View State** to the View via observable state holders like **Kotlin Flow**. User actions trigger updates to this state.
* **ViewState**: A common, immutable state for a single view, acting as a single source of truth.

### üß† Domain Layer

This is the core layer of the application. It contains the business logic and is completely independent of other layers. Changes to the UI (Presentation) or data source (Data) will not affect this layer.

* **UseCase**: Contains the application's business logic, orchestrating actions and data flow.
* **DomainModel**: Defines the core structure of the data used within the application. This is the source of truth for all application data.
* **Repository Interface**: An abstraction that defines the contract for data access. It allows the Domain layer to remain independent from the specific data implementation in the Data layer.

### üíæ Data Layer

This layer is responsible for encapsulating application data. It provides the necessary data to the Domain layer and handles the details of data retrieval, storage, and synchronization.

* **Repository**: Implements the repository interface defined in the Domain layer. It's responsible for fetching data from one or more data sources (e.g., network, local database).
* **Mapper**: Transforms data from **Data Models** (e.g., API responses, database entities) into **Domain Models**, ensuring the Domain layer remains decoupled from the specific data source implementation.
* **Data Sources**: The low-level implementation for data access, such as **Ktor** for network requests or **Room** for local database storage.

</p>

---

## üß© Modularization

The codebase is organized into multiple Gradle modules to improve maintainability, scalability, and reusability. This modular approach enables independent development, easier testing, and faster build times, while supporting code sharing across all supported platforms.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./icons/Modularization.png" width="800" alt="Modularization Diagram" />
</p>

* **:app**: The main application module that wires everything together. It contains platform-specific code for each target (Android, JVM, WASM) and the entry points for the application.
* **:features:**: Feature-specific modules (e.g., `main`, `detail`, `setting`) that contain all the code related to a given feature, including its Presentation, Domain, and Data layers.
* **:modules**: Common library modules that are shared across different parts of the application. Examples include `designsystem`, `network`, `database`, `data`, and `domain`.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Open-source Libraries

This project leverages a modern, production-ready tech stack and a curated set of open-source libraries to ensure high performance, maintainability, and a delightful developer experience.

* **Multiplatform**:
    * **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP)**: Enables code sharing of business logic across Android, JVM, and WASM platforms.
    * **Jetpack Compose & Compose Multiplatform**: The modern, declarative UI toolkit for building native user interfaces across all platforms from a single codebase.
* **Architecture**:
    * **Clean Architecture**: A software architecture that promotes a scalable, maintainable, and testable codebase by separating concerns into distinct layers.
    * **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow**: Used for asynchronous and reactive programming, providing a streamlined way to handle background operations and data streams.
    * **Koin**: A pragmatic and lightweight dependency injection framework that simplifies dependency management.
* **Data & Networking**:
    * **Ktor**: An asynchronous HTTP client for making network requests across all platforms.
    * **Kotlinx Serialization**: A powerful library for serializing and deserializing JSON data in a type-safe manner.
    * **Room**: A local database library for structured data persistence on Android.
    * **DataStore**: A modern and type-safe data storage solution for simple, key-value pairs or typed objects on Android.
* **Testing & Quality**:
    * **Spotless, ktlint, detekt**: Static analysis tools for enforcing consistent code formatting and detecting code smells.
    * **JUnit 5 & Turbine**: Testing frameworks for writing robust unit and integration tests.
    * **Jacoco**: A code coverage tool to measure the effectiveness of your test suite.
* **Deployment**:
    * **Hydraulic Conveyor**: A powerful tool to package and distribute desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## üß™ Testing

Kmtemplate provides a robust testing suite to ensure code quality, reliability, and UI consistency across all platforms.

### JVM Tests

  * **Unit Tests**: Validate individual components and functions in isolation.
  * **Integration Tests**: Ensure correct interaction between modules and system components.
  * **Data Layer Tests**: Check data access, persistence, and retrieval logic.
  * **Business Logic Tests**: Confirm the correct implementation of business rules and workflows.

Run all JVM tests with:

```sh
./gradlew jvmTest
```

### UI Screenshot Testing

Compose Screenshot Testing helps prevent visual regressions by comparing the current UI against baseline images ("goldens").

Automated screenshot tests are powered by the Compose Screenshot Test. Key Gradle tasks include:

  * `validateFossReliantDebugScreenshotTest`: Run all screenshot tests and compare with baseline images to detect visual changes.
  * `updateFossReliantDebugScreenshotTest`: Update baseline images after intentional UI changes.
  * `testFossReliantDebugScreenshotTest`: Generate comparison images highlighting differences between failed tests and baselines.

These tools ensure your UI remains visually consistent and any unintended changes are caught early.

-----

## üö¶ Performance

Kmtemplate is optimized for speed, responsiveness, and efficiency across all supported platforms. The project integrates several tools and strategies to monitor and improve performance:

### Benchmarks

  * Automated benchmarking tools are used to measure the performance of critical operations, including UI rendering, data processing, and network requests.
  * Benchmark results help identify bottlenecks and guide targeted optimizations for a smooth user experience.

### Baseline Profiles

  * **Baseline Profiles** are included in the build process to improve app startup time and reduce initial rendering latency.
  * These profiles instruct the Android Runtime (ART) to pre-compile frequently used code paths, resulting in faster launches and better runtime performance.

Generate a Baseline Profile with:

```sh
./gradlew generateReleaseBaselineProfile
```

### Compose Compiler Metrics

  * **Compose Compiler Metrics** provide insights into UI performance, such as recomposition counts and skippability rates.
  * These metrics help proactively detect and resolve inefficiencies, ensuring the Compose UI remains fast and responsive as the app evolves.

Enable Compose Compiler Metrics with:

```sh
./gradlew assembleDebug -PenableComposeCompilerMetrics=true -PenableComposeCompilerReports=true
```
