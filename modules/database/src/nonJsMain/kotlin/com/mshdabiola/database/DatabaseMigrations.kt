/**
 * Automatic schema migrations sometimes require extra instructions to perform the migration, for
 * example, when a column is renamed. These extra instructions are placed here by creating a class
 * using the following naming convention `SchemaXtoY` where X is the schema version you're migrating
 * from and Y is the schema version you're migrating to. The class should implement
